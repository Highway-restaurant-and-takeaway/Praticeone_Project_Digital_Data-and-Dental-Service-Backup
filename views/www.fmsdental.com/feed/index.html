								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Benefits of CBCT scan include 90% less radiation exposure &amp; zero discomfort. <em><strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">FMS DENTAL</span> uses <span style="color: #800000;"><a style="color: #800000; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.fmsdental.com/cbct/">CBCT scan</a> </span>for all guided surgeries like Dental Implants etc.</strong></em></p>
<p>Two dimensional radiographs like periapical and panoramic radiographs have always been used extensively since the past 25 years. 2D x-rays have few problems like low-definition images, distortion and superimposition resulting in erroneous diagnosis at times. In cases that need more clarity in imaging, patients were referred to medical (spiral) CT scan that had its own problems like higher exposure to radiation and longer procedure time.</p>
<p>CBCT scans have evolved as a game changer in dental radiography and its introduction has definitely added an extra dimension to customized dental care delivery.</p>
<p>Have you experienced the difference between 2D and a 3D movie? How realistic it feels to watch the 3D one! Well that’s exactly the difference one can perceive in 2D and 3D scans. <strong><em>FMS Dental Hospital </em></strong>has walked an extra mile to deliver healthy smiles by introducing this <span style="color: #ff6600;"><em><strong>tremendous advancement of diagnostic technology</strong>.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong><img class="wp-image-7418 size-full aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.fmsdental.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cbct-scan.jpg?resize=592%2C309&#038;ssl=1" alt="advantages of CBCT scan" width="592" height="309" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.fmsdental.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cbct-scan.jpg?w=592&amp;ssl=1 592w, https://i1.wp.com/www.fmsdental.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cbct-scan.jpg?resize=300%2C157&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 592px) 100vw, 592px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>What is a CBCT scan?</strong></span><br />
It’s basically a three-dimensional radiograph. CBCT stands for “Cone Beam Computed Tomography”. It is quite similar to the “CAT scan” technology used in the medical domain. The difference is that a cone-shaped beam is used to image a small area exclusively with significantly less radiation.  There is lesser distortion as compared to 2D images. Accurate measurements of the bone density, bone height and width are possible.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong><em>CARESTREAM CS 9300, the latest and one of the best in CBCT technology, is being used at FMS since the past 6 years for our more complex dental cases.</em></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>When do you need one?</strong></span><br />
You may be asked by your dentist to get a CBCT scan done in the following cases-</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dental implants</strong> –for the precise planning and placement of dental implants.</li>
<li>For Assessment of<strong> Relative Bone Quality</strong></li>
<li><strong>Root canal treatment- </strong>for clear-cut viewing of root canals.</li>
<li><strong>Temporomandibular Joint</strong>&#8211; for diagnosis of TMJ related problems</li>
<li><strong>Impacted teeth</strong> – for checking the position of the impacted tooth in relation to the neighboring structures like mandibular nerve and maxillary sinus.</li>
<li><strong>Orthodontic treatment</strong>&#8211; for evaluation of the facial structures and teeth.<strong> </strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfwF9X6CWe4&amp;t=3s"><span style="color: #800000;"><strong><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration: underline;">What are the benefits of CBCT scan over 2D radiographs?</span></strong></span></a></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Benefits of CBCT scan include high definition images with exceptional details.</li>
<li>Multidimensional assessment is possible as multiple images are generated in various planes.</li>
<li>Helpful in accurate diagnosis and treatment planning.</li>
<li>Beneficial for Guided Surgeries.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>What are the advantages of CBCT scans over CT scans?</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li>90% less radiation exposure as compared to CT scans.</li>
<li>Quick procedure of 30 seconds to a minute as compared to one hour procedure in CT scans.</li>
<li>No discomfort like claustrophobia or loud noise</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">CBCT</span> </strong>or 3D imaging is surely going to shape the future of dental diagnosis and treatment planning. This quick and painless procedure helps in accurate assessment of your facial skeleton and helps in planning of reconstructive and cosmetic dentistry procedures.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about the CBCT Scan or are interested in getting one done and knowing more about it, call us at <strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">040 2222 1111</span></strong>.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff6600;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>LANAP: Healing Touch of Lasers on Diseased Gums</strong></span></span></p>
<p>Have you ever been embarrassed by your bad breath? Do you have bleeding while brushing teeth or have a faintly loose tooth? You may be having diseased gums that need immediate attention before it worsens.</p>
<p>Gum surgery is the solution but did you ever imagine that it could <span style="color: #800000;"><strong><em>be a painless, bloodless or no-needles surgery</em></strong>?</span></p>
<p>Yes, it can!</p>
<p>The advent of lasers in dentistry has made it possible today. Lasers have been brought into extensive use in treatment of eye and skin problems and have established its utility in various dental treatment procedures as well.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">FMS Dental Hospitals,</span> <span style="color: #800000;">Hyderabad, India</span></strong> offers this advanced Laser treatment option in the form of LANAP –<em><u>the healing touch of LASERs on diseased gums</u></em>.</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>What is the LANAP protocol?</strong></span></p>
<p>Laser Assisted New Attachment Procedure or LANAP, is a minimally invasive treatment procedure used to treat gum disease. Inflamed or unhealthy gums that cannot be restored back to normal by procedures like scaling and root planing are indicated for flap surgeries. A conventional flap surgery entails separating of gums from teeth for enhanced accessibility and visibility. Few cases of flap surgery can be avoided through LANAP protocol wherein specific dental lasers like Diode, NdYAG and Erbium (Waterlase and Fotona Lightwalker) are used to treat gum disease and help in reattachment of periodontal ligament to cementum and alveolar bone.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Who is a candidate for LANAP laser surgery?</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li>LANAP has emerged as an excellent gum treatment regime for patients who are immunocompromised due to systemic illnesses like uncontrolled diabetes or infections like HIV. In both the cases, performing flap surgery is always loaded with obvious risks like problematic healing and questionable recovery.</li>
<li>Patients with mild gum disease can especially benefit as no elaborate opening of flap is required.</li>
<li>The LANAP protocol is the best for patients who are fearful of conventional scalpel surgery.</li>
<li>Those who have tooth mobility or severe gum recession are the best candidates for LANAP.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong><img class="aligncenter wp-image-13509 " src="https://i0.wp.com/www.fmsdental.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Benefits-of-LANAP-Treatment-for-Gum-Disease-FMS-DENTAL-Hyderabad-India.jpg?resize=446%2C250&#038;ssl=1" alt="Benefits of LANAP Treatment for Gum Disease" width="446" height="250" data-recalc-dims="1" /></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>What is the procedure involved in LANAP Protocol?</strong></span></p>
<p>The steps involved in the procedure are as follows-</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>&#8211; You may need to be anesthetized with local anesthesia.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>&#8211; Lasers are passed in the area between the gum and tooth (also called as gingival sulcus), clearing away the sick epithelium.</p>
<p><strong>Steps 3- </strong>The roots of the teeth are scaled to eliminate any remaining tartar and plaque.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong>&#8211; Afterwards the lasers are run again around the teeth in the gingival sulcus to induce fresh bleeding.  The clot formed, thereafter, seals the pocket and facilitates the process of new attachment of gums.</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>What are the Benefits of LANAP Treatment for Gum Disease?</strong></span></p>
<p>The primary benefits of LANAP laser surgery, compared to traditional cut-and-sew surgery, are:</p>
<ul>
<li><u>Less post-operative pain</u> —The LANAP protocol avoids the cutting and stitching of the gums. As a result, patients usually have minimal post-operative discomfort.</li>
<li><u>Quicker recovery time</u> — Most patients are able to return to their regular daily activities immediately following the procedure. Generally, it requires less than a 24-hour recovery period.</li>
<li><u>Healthy gums with minimal recession</u> —As the LANAP protocol does not cut your gums, the tissue stays intact and does not shrink. Moreover, this procedure promotes regeneration of supporting gum tissues</li>
</ul>
<p>If your gums have become a source of trouble for you, FMS Dental Hospital specialists can help you with best and most advanced treatment options in the form of LASERs. Are you ready to experience the healing touch of LASERs?</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One question that has been repeatedly asked every day by our patients is <span style="color: #ff6600;"><em>“How many implants do you want to place in my edentulous jaw to replace the missing teeth; isn’t just 4 enough?”</em></span></p>
<p>To answer this, we need a clinical examination and a CBCT scan to assess the available bone. Sometimes virtual digital planning will give a correct dimension (size) and number of Implants required for the patients.</p>
<p>Over a decade, our FMS DENTAL Implantology team that consists of Implantologists, Maxillofacial surgeons &amp; Prosthodontists, with the support of in-house <span style="color: #800000;"><strong><a style="color: #800000;" href="https://www.fmsdental.com/the-fms-dental-lab/">CAD-CAM dental lab</a> </strong></span>have treated hundreds of patients with different implant protocols depending on the available jaw bone.</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong><u>Tilted (All-on-4 ) vs. Straight (All-on-8 )Dental Implants:</u></strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-13417 size-large" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.fmsdental.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/All-on-4-Dental-Implants-FMS-DENTAL.jpg?resize=1024%2C513&#038;ssl=1" alt="Tilted vs Straight Dental Implants" width="1024" height="513" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.fmsdental.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/All-on-4-Dental-Implants-FMS-DENTAL.jpg?resize=1024%2C513&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/www.fmsdental.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/All-on-4-Dental-Implants-FMS-DENTAL.jpg?resize=300%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.fmsdental.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/All-on-4-Dental-Implants-FMS-DENTAL.jpg?resize=768%2C385&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.fmsdental.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/All-on-4-Dental-Implants-FMS-DENTAL.jpg?w=1105&amp;ssl=1 1105w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>We always like to place 7-8 dental implants parallel to each other (straight) whenever sufficient bone is available in the jaw. Zirconia or composite teeth can be fixed over these implants either with a cementable or screwable option. For more than 20 years, this protocol has been followed <span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>where parallelism is given importance while placing implants</strong>.</span></p>
<p>But most of the time, patients delay in opting for full mouth rehabilitation with implants. As a result, the jaw bone keep resorbing and there will be hardly any bone left on the backside of the jaws because of maxillary sinus pneumatisation in the upper &amp; the position of the mandibular nerve in the lower jaws. Apart from that, patients delay the removal of infected teeth till it loses all the bone and becomes totally mobile.</p>
<p>Earlier days, an additional surgery was required to graft the bone in these situations with sinus lift in the upper jaw and a block graft in the lower jaw by taking bone graft from Iliac Crest or any other site of the body. After a waiting period of 6-8 months, implant surgery used to be performed in the grafted area.</p>
<p>Now, with the revolutionary change in the implant and abutment (connector) designs, a new concept called All-on-4 has been developed. In this protocol, the support from the front &amp; middle part of the jaw bone is taken and two straight Implants and two long tilted implants that emerge posteriorly are placed. These 4 Implants will be supporting 12-14 teeth based on its positioning and length.</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong><a style="color: #800000;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWL176rpAqs">Advantages of All-on-4 dental implants:</a></strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Highly predictable &amp; success rate above 99%</li>
<li>No second surgery, no grafting and no waiting time</li>
<li>Immediate fixed provisional teeth in 2-4 days followed by permanent teeth after 5-6 months.</li>
<li>Strong screwable prosthesis with zirconia or composite resin teeth on titanium, zirconium or peek frameworks. This way of replacing crowns on a screwable framework gives excellent results with signature smiles &amp; aesthetics.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the hands of expert implantologists, whether it is all-on-4 tilted or all-on-8 straight implant protocol based on the available bone, patients will regain their chewing comfort, phonetics (speech) and lost self-esteem.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff6600; font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Vizilite PRO: Prevention Now Possible Through Quick Screening</strong></span></h1>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">FMS</span> <span style="color: #800000;">Dental</span></strong> takes pride in promoting health and wellness through holistic approach by not only treating dental problems and designing your smile but also preserving the integrity of your body as a whole through early detection of any abnormal activity of cells inside the mouth. Oral cancer screening once in every six months is very important.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-13024 size-full alignleft" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.fmsdental.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/oral-cancer-screening-with-ViziLitePRO-at-FMS-DENTAL-India.jpg?resize=200%2C300" alt="oral cancer screening" width="200" height="300" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>As a step towards the realization of this holistic approach, a unique and innovative fluorescent screening device called <strong><span style="color: #800000;"><a style="color: #800000;" href="https://www.dentistryiq.com/articles/2016/12/denmat-launches-vizilite-pro-oral-lesion-screening-system.html">Vizilite PRO</a></span></strong>, is used during every routine oral examination to rule out any abnormalities that can progress to life-threatening conditions like oral cancer in future. Besides, it comes as a huge sigh of relief for those who fear invasive procedures like biopsy as it is a quick, painless and totally non-invasive.</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Reversible When Caught Early</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li>One must understand that oral cancer is the disease in which there are uncontrolled cell divisions of the tissue involved, resulting in destruction of the normal tissues in its vicinity.</li>
<li>Generally, oral cancer is preceded by few precancerous lesions that appear in the form of white or red patches inside the mouth.</li>
<li>When diagnosed in this early stage, oral cancer can be treated successfully.</li>
<li>But, every white/red patch is <strong>NOT </strong></li>
<li>This is why, fluorescent screening is vital as it reveals<strong> ONLY</strong> suspicious discolorations, sores or swellings and can be used as adjunct to detect the presence of altered tissues in the mouth</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="color: #800000; font-size: 14pt;"><strong>How does Vizilite PRO work?</strong></span></h2>
<ul>
<li>The ViziLite PRO is the device used for fluorescent screening at <span style="color: #800000;"><strong>FMS International Dental Center, Jubilee Hills, Hyderabad.</strong></span></li>
<li>This examination is a simple and painless process and it just adds about few minutes to the conventional dental examination.</li>
<li>The principle of this aid is to detect abnormal activity of the cells of the mouth by directing a fluorescent light.</li>
<li>Once the clinician activates the ViziLite PRO device, five shortwave, violet-output LEDs generate biofluorescence and enhance the visualization.</li>
</ul>
<p>The suspicious tissue revealed needs immediate attention and is considered for microscopic examination through biopsy. <span style="color: #ff6600;"><em><strong>Biopsy</strong></em></span> is the definitive method of examining the tissues and <em><span style="color: #ff6600;">detecting the cancer cells</span></em>.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #800000; font-size: 14pt;"><strong>FMS in-house CAD CAM Dental Lab: Where Creativity Meets Quality</strong></span></h2>
<p>It’s a well-known fact that dentistry can reach the pinnacle of perfection only through the exuberant teamwork of expert dentists and dental technicians along with a well-equipped dental laboratory. You might not be aware that only few dental clinics have their own in-house CAD CAM Dental Lab. <em>In-house CAD CAM Dental Lab is a boon to any dental practice. FMS DENTAL hosts an in-house CAD CAM dental lab with senior Prosthodontists and technicians. </em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-13007 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.fmsdental.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Best-CAD-CAM-Dental-lab-FMS-Dental-India.jpg?resize=1024%2C421" alt="in-house CAD CAM Dental Lab" width="1024" height="421" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.fmsdental.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Best-CAD-CAM-Dental-lab-FMS-Dental-India.jpg?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/www.fmsdental.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Best-CAD-CAM-Dental-lab-FMS-Dental-India.jpg?resize=300%2C123&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.fmsdental.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Best-CAD-CAM-Dental-lab-FMS-Dental-India.jpg?resize=768%2C316&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>In most of the cases, dentists get their lab-work done by outsourcing it to the neighboring dental labs. FMS Dental Hospitals takes pride in being one among the very few dental centers in the country to have an in-house CAD CAM Dental Lab with some of the world’s best CAD-CAM systems  and 3D printers brought in use.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>So what’s the big deal about having an <span style="color: #ff6600;"><a style="color: #ff6600;" href="http://www.fmsdental.com/the-fms-dental-lab/">in-house dental lab</a></span>?</strong> </span></h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-13008 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.fmsdental.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Best-CAD-CAM-Dental-lab-FMS-Dental.jpg?resize=459%2C357" alt="in-house CAD CAM Dental Lab" width="459" height="357" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.fmsdental.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Best-CAD-CAM-Dental-lab-FMS-Dental.jpg?w=459&amp;ssl=1 459w, https://i1.wp.com/www.fmsdental.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Best-CAD-CAM-Dental-lab-FMS-Dental.jpg?resize=300%2C233&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 459px) 100vw, 459px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Suppose you wish to purchase an exquisite garment for yourself. There is always an option of a readymade store or a mall where you can search for the dress of your choice. Another option is to visit an expert tailor, who just like a talented craftsman, will prepare the dress that suits your taste and fits you snugly. Apart from that, this tailor will ensure that every detail mentioned by you (like the color and type of material) is incorporated in the design. Moreover, he will be happy to work on modifications, if any, from your end so that you receive the garment with exclusive customization. So now, <span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>which option would you go for?</strong></span></p>
<p>Let’s think about the above mentioned example in the perspective of a dental clinic/hospital. For any prosthesis to be long-lasting and precise, it should be fabricated with the scope of zero error and should provide a choice of individual customizations.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>How can I benefit from FMS In-House Dental Lab?</strong></span></h4>
<p><strong><img class="alignnone wp-image-13009 size-medium" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.fmsdental.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Best-CAD-CAM-Dental-lab-FMS-Dental-Hospital-India-300x169.jpg?resize=300%2C169" alt="in-house CAD CAM Dental Lab" width="300" height="169" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.fmsdental.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Best-CAD-CAM-Dental-lab-FMS-Dental-Hospital-India.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.fmsdental.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Best-CAD-CAM-Dental-lab-FMS-Dental-Hospital-India.jpg?w=701&amp;ssl=1 701w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" />                                                  <img class="alignnone wp-image-13010 size-medium" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.fmsdental.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Best-CAD-CAM-lab-FMS-DENTAL-300x169.jpg?resize=300%2C169" alt="in-house CAD CAM Dental Lab" width="300" height="169" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.fmsdental.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Best-CAD-CAM-lab-FMS-DENTAL.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.fmsdental.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Best-CAD-CAM-lab-FMS-DENTAL.jpg?w=701&amp;ssl=1 701w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></strong></p>

<h3><span style="color: #ff6600;"><em><strong>What is a Hollywood Smile?</strong></em></span></h3>
<p>For a smile to be classified as a Hollywood smile, it should be nothing less than PERFECT which means a set of absolutely symmetrical and sparkling bright-white colored teeth. Listed below are few important aspects of a Hollywood smile-</p>
<ol>
<li>The <strong>color </strong>of the teeth should be in contrast with the color of the skin and the white of the eye. <strong>Bright white</strong> shade is the most preferable one when it comes to Hollywood smiles.</li>
<li>The<strong> Smile line</strong> should be parallel to the imaginary line that is formed by joining the pupils of the eyes and edges of the upper teeth should be parallel to the lower lip.</li>
<li><strong>Symmetry</strong>&#8211; Teeth when viewed from both the sides should be balanced.</li>
<li><strong>Gender-specific-</strong> For women, slender and oval shape is recommended for that perfect feminine look whereas for men squarish, slightly bulky and round teeth look better and masculine. Minor procedures like enamel recontouring to veneers can be done to bring about the above mentioned changes.</li>
<li><strong>Balanced gums- </strong>The gums should be well-contoured and pale pink in color. The gum-line and the upper lip should be in line with each other thereby, keeping the gum exposure at the minimum. Procedures like gum contouring and gum depigmentation can bring about dramatic changes to the shape, color and texture of the gums.</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Popular Cosmetic Dental Procedures involved in the Hollywood Smile Makeover</strong></span></p>
<p>Even though, a number of cosmetic dental procedures are performed to craft a celebrity Smile, two most commonly used procedures are-</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>Professional Teeth Whitening</strong></span></p>
<p>Darkening of teeth can happen as a result of aging process or due to the regular consumption of staining food products and beverages like tea or coffee. Professional teeth whitening or bleaching as we commonly know it as, can transform your smile and turn discolored or stained teeth lighter and whiter by many shades.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Dental Veneers/ Laminates</strong></span></p>
<p>Veneers are shells made of tooth-colored porcelain that are fixed commonly on the upper front teeth, as they tend to show the most when someone smiles, laughs or speaks. They repair &amp; beautify cracked or stained teeth, lengthen or shorten teeth &amp; also fix gaps between teeth. While selecting the shade for veneers, the color of the face and skin is also taken into consideration. Bright white shade is preferred to achieve the dazzling Hollywood Smile.</p>
<p>The cosmetic dentists at FMS International Dental Center, Hyderabad, India, are specialists in Digital Smile Designing (DSD) and ensure to incorporate even the minutest detail while customizing the treatment plan for you. The state-of-art in-house dental CAD CAM lab at FMS is a big boon to the personalization of veneers alongside faster completion of smile makeovers.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>So, think no more, look no further. </strong></span><em><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>It’s time to act fast &amp; start off RIGHT now!</strong></span></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just book a consultation with our cosmetic dental specialist and experience the Hollywood beam this New Year!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><span style="color: #ff6600; font-size: 14pt;"><strong><em>Does your smile look like- Less Teeth, More gums? If yes, then you may be having a gummy smile.</em></strong></span></h2>
<p>An aesthetically appealing smile is possible only if the gums are healthy and the gum display is in proportion and harmony with the shape, dimension, color and position of the teeth. Undue display of gums during smiling is considered as an esthetic setback.</p>
<p>Generally, simple procedures like crown-lengthening, gum contouring or <span style="color: #602525;"><strong><a style="color: #602525;" href="http://www.fmsdental.com/gummy-smile-correction/">botox</a></strong></span> injections can rectify a gummy smile effectively. In cases where the cause of gummy smile is a short upper lip or an underlying skeletal defect like a protruding jaw, these treatment modalities may not be enough. That’s when surgical correction procedures come into play.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ed832f;"><a style="color: #ed832f;" href="http://www.fmsdental.com/orthognathic-surgery/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Orthognathic surgery</span></a></span>&#8211; </strong>These surgeries are performed on the upper and/or the lower jaw to correct cosmetic or functional defects of jaws. Many a times, these surgeries are combined with the braces treatment also.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gummy smile can occur if the upper jaw bone is more in height or is protruded forth. The correction of bone related defects can be dealt with an effective combination of orthognathic surgery (or jaw surgery) and braces. Hence, an expert team of oral and maxillofacial surgeon and orthodontist is required to produce the desirable outcome.</p>
<ul>
<li>Two most common surgical approaches used for gummy smile correction are namely- Le Fort I osteotomy and Anterior Maxillary Osteotomy (AMO).</li>
<li>In case of Le Fort I osteotomy, a cut is made on the upper jaw bone just above the roots of your teeth in such a way that the complete jaw (which means the upper teeth and the roof of your mouth) can be moved as a single segment.</li>
<li>The excess portion is shaved off and then the upper jaw can be moved in different directions (inwards/upwards/backwards) to achieve desirable results.</li>
<li>The contact between the upper and lower teeth while biting is established.</li>
<li>Then, the jaw bone is secured in its new position through plates and screws.</li>
<li>In case of Anterior Maxillary Osteotomy (AMO), only the front part of the upper jaw bone is sectioned and the extra bone causing protrusion is trimmed off.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even though jaw surgery entails a slightly longer recovery time and is on the higher end in terms of procedure and the treatment charges, it still remains the best treatment option for severe gummy smile problems due to the guaranteed phenomenal outcome it delivers.<strong> </strong><img class="alignnone wp-image-12815 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.fmsdental.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Facial-Fillers-Botox-Specialist-FMS-DENTAL-HOSPITAL-Hyderabad-India.png?resize=1380%2C430" alt="gummy smile correction" width="1380" height="430" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.fmsdental.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Facial-Fillers-Botox-Specialist-FMS-DENTAL-HOSPITAL-Hyderabad-India.png?w=1380&amp;ssl=1 1380w, https://i2.wp.com/www.fmsdental.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Facial-Fillers-Botox-Specialist-FMS-DENTAL-HOSPITAL-Hyderabad-India.png?resize=300%2C93&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.fmsdental.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Facial-Fillers-Botox-Specialist-FMS-DENTAL-HOSPITAL-Hyderabad-India.png?resize=768%2C239&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.fmsdental.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Facial-Fillers-Botox-Specialist-FMS-DENTAL-HOSPITAL-Hyderabad-India.png?resize=1024%2C319&amp;ssl=1 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>2. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ed832f; text-decoration: underline;">Lip lengthening/repositioning surgery</span></span></strong>&#8211; A short lip leading to excessive gum display can be corrected by lip repositioning or lip lengthening surgery. Procedures like <strong>V-Y lip closure</strong> are performed on the inner side of the lip and can produce predictive results for moderate gummy smile correction. The procedure can take about an hour for completion.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-12816 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.fmsdental.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Best-Dental-Specialist-FMS-DENTAL-HOSPITAL-Hyderabad-India.jpg?resize=500%2C345" alt="gummy smile correction" width="500" height="345" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.fmsdental.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Best-Dental-Specialist-FMS-DENTAL-HOSPITAL-Hyderabad-India.jpg?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i1.wp.com/www.fmsdental.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Best-Dental-Specialist-FMS-DENTAL-HOSPITAL-Hyderabad-India.jpg?resize=300%2C207&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The lips become more fuller through this procedure and the problem of undue gum display is reduced. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWL176rpAqs"><span style="color: #602525;"><strong>The result is a confident smile and a BETTER you!</strong></span></a></p>
<p>Correct diagnosis paves the way to the right solution to any complex cosmetic problem. So, you should visit your cosmetic dental specialist to understand what the reason of your gummy smile is and then get personalized treatment plan for the same.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ed832f;">Gummy smile?</span></h2>
<p>Do you feel that your gums are the first thing people notice when you smile? Does your smile reveal more of gums than teeth? You may be having a <span style="color: #602525;"><strong><a style="color: #602525;" href="http://www.fmsdental.com/excessive-gum-display-treatment-insight/">Gummy smile</a></strong></span>, <em>the term used to describe the smile of a person when the gums are displayed more than usual.</em></p>
<p>When the distance between the gum line and the upper lip is more than 3 to 4 mm, it is perceived as an excessive display of gums. Over-display of gums can have a detrimental impact on the smile aesthetics and can be a cause for low self-esteem.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #602525;"><strong>What are the reasons for a <span style="color: #602525;"><a style="color: #602525;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h17oeAT9S1k">gummy smile</a></span>?</strong></span></h3>
<ul>
<li>Improper eruption causing the gums to cover more of the teeth surface</li>
<li>Smaller teeth due to genetic predisposition or physiological wear</li>
<li>Short upper lip</li>
<li>Hyperactive upper lip</li>
<li>Gums enlargement</li>
<li>Protruding upper jaw</li>
</ul>
<p>So now you know that your teeth, lips and gums are like pieces of smile puzzle that should fall in correct proportion to each other for optimum esthetics.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #ed832f;"><strong>Can a gummy smile be fixed?</strong></span></h3>
<p>Yes, a gummy smile can be fixed!</p>
<p>The treatment approach depends on the underlying cause. Here are some of the simple ways of fixing a gummy smile.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h4><span style="color: #602525;"><strong>Crown lengthening with <a style="color: #602525;" href="http://www.fmsdental.com/enamel-tooth-recontouring/">enamel recontouring</a></strong></span></h4>
<p>In cases, where the eruption process is the cause, crown lengthening is the best procedure for correction. During this process, the extra gum tissue covering the tooth is removed thereby exposing more of the tooth surface. This makes the crown (visible surface of tooth) look elongated and reduces the extent of gum display as well. Through enamel recontouring, the tooth length is brought into the right proportion so that the crown dimensions are in proportion with the face.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-12794" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.fmsdental.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Best-Cosmetic-Dentist-FMS-DENTAL-HOSPITAL-Hyderabad-India-300x284.jpg?resize=450%2C426" alt="gummy smile " width="450" height="426" data-recalc-dims="1" /></li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h4><span style="color: #ed832f;"><strong>Crown lengthening with <a style="color: #ed832f;" href="http://www.fmsdental.com/dental-veneers-laminates/">Veneers/Laminates</a> or <a style="color: #ed832f;" href="http://www.fmsdental.com/metal-free-crown/">dental crowns</a></strong></span></h4>
<p>Small-sized teeth can be fixed by options like dental crowns and dental veneers/laminates.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h4><a href="http://www.fmsdental.com/gum-recontouring/"><span style="color: #602525;"><strong><span style="color: #602525;">Gum contouring</span></strong> </span></a></h4>
<p>The surgical removal of enlarged gums and reshaping is called gum contouring and it leads to a remarkable enhancement in the appearance of the smile. Lasers, when used for gum contouring, eliminate the need to go under the knife thereby making the procedure bloodless and also cause faster healing than conventional gum contouring procedure.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-12795 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.fmsdental.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Best-Facial-Fillers-Botox-Specialist-FMS-DENTAL-HOSPITAL-Hyderabad-India.jpg?resize=613%2C526" alt="gummy smile" width="613" height="526" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.fmsdental.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Best-Facial-Fillers-Botox-Specialist-FMS-DENTAL-HOSPITAL-Hyderabad-India.jpg?w=613&amp;ssl=1 613w, https://i1.wp.com/www.fmsdental.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Best-Facial-Fillers-Botox-Specialist-FMS-DENTAL-HOSPITAL-Hyderabad-India.jpg?resize=300%2C257&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 613px) 100vw, 613px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h4><span style="color: #ed832f;"><strong>Botox</strong> </span></h4>
<p>Botox (Type A botulinum toxin) is a neuromodulator and is being used extensively in cosmetic procedures like wrinkle corrections. Botox is used effectively to treat gummy smile caused by a short or a hyperactive upper lip. Even though botox turns out to be more affordable than surgery, one drawback is that the results are of short term and last for around three to eight months only. The botox injections weaken the hyperactive lip muscle thereby minimizing the excess lifting of upper lip while smiling.</li>
</ol>
<p>In some situations, the above mentioned procedures may not suffice and surgical correction of gummy smile may be needed. Lip repositioning/lengthening and orthognathic surgery are the two most common techniques of correcting a gummy smile.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600;"><em>So, when there are so many treatment options to get rid of a gummy smile why to live with it anymore! Consult your periodontist to know which option suits you the most.</em></span></p>

<p>Invisible braces come extremely handy for those who have a nomadic career like IT professionals. This is because the entire sequence of clear aligners is handed over to the wearer right in the beginning along with the directions of use. As their occupation demands travel most of the time, conventional braces are little uncomfortable for them.</p>
